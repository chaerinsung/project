                <p>At the start of the semester for my UI/UX class, I was tasked with pitching an idea for an app or website. 
                Being in a generation where dating apps such as Hinge, Tinder, Bumble, etc have become the norm, I have always heard peers around me 
                complaining that they can never join a dating app because they are too shy or introverted. Thus, I decided to pitch an idea for a dating app
                that allows for more anonymity and allows for connections beyond romantic ones, such as professional or friendships.</p>
                
                <p>After presenting my pitch, my class voted on the ideas that they would want to work on throughout the semester. Fortunately, my app was chosen 
                and I was given the responsibility of being team lead and lead designer for my app idea: SC Connect.</p>

                <p>Below is my original pitch.</p>

                <p>People want to connect with others but struggle to do so due to being shy, introverted, and/or socially anxious. They do not want to reveal too much personal information about themselves on the internet.</p>
                <p>The majority of dating apps focus on romantic connections rather than giving the option of other types of connections: friendships or professional relationships.</p>
                <p>There are no live-time dating apps. For example, if there is someone next to you that you want to connect with, there is no app that allows you to connect with them unless you speak to them in person.</p>
                <p>There are no connection apps that are specific to individuals who attend the same school.</p>

                <p>Users can only be USC students. To login, users have to use their USC emails.</p>
                <p>Users are able to customize their level of anonymity:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users are able to create their own usernames if they would not like to reveal their names.</li>
                        <li>Users are able to customize their own avatars.</li>
                        <li>Users are able to turn on/off the types of relationships they are available for -- romantic, friendship, and/or professional.</li>
                        <li>Chatrooms with other users are only accessed when both users accept the connection.</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>Digital to In-Person Connections</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>When two users mutually accept the connection request and click 'yes' to opening a chatroom, an unveiling page is revealed.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The unveiling page reveals the user's information: real name, photo, major, and year.</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The app provides live-time features. How?
                    <ul>
                        <li>On the home page, there is a map of USC campus and other users who have turned on their location services. If users turn on their locations, they can see their avatars and will be visible to other users in a 0.5 mile radius.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Locations can always be toggled on/off for privacy conscious people.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>For the users who have their locations turned on, they can click on other users and send a connection request.</li>
                        <li>Daily, there is an optional color popup to prompt users to change the color of their outfits.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>This allows other users to confirm that the person they see in person match the avatar they see on their map.</li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
