                <p>At the start of the semester for my UI/UX class, I was tasked with pitching an idea for an app or website. 
                Being in a generation where dating apps such as Hinge, Tinder, Bumble, etc have become the norm, I have always heard peers around me 
                complaining that they can never join a dating app because they are too shy or introverted. Thus, I decided to pitch an idea for a dating app
                that allows for more anonymity and allows for connections beyond romantic ones, such as professional or friendships.</p>
                
                <p>After presenting my pitch, my class voted on the ideas that they would want to work on throughout the semester. Fortunately, my app was chosen 
                and I was given the responsibility of being team lead and lead designer for my app idea: SC Connect.</p>

                <p>Below is my original pitch.</p>
